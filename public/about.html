<p>There is a lot to tell when it comes to speak about Syed Saleem@Suhan as a person. 
  He is a guy with a motive to spread his vision amongst the people. 
  His family, friends and the people around him appreciated his thoughts and vision which in 
  turn led him to portrait them in the form of a book.
